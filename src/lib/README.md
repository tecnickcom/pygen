## Description

~#SHORTDESCRIPTION#~


## Requirements

```
sudo pip install json-spec
```

## Quick Start

This project includes a Makefile that allows you to test and build the project in a Linux-compatible system with simple commands.

To see all available options:
```
make help
```

To build a Conda development environment:
```
make conda_dev
. activate
```

To build and test the project inside a Conda environment:  
```
make build
```

The coverage report is available at:  
```env-~#PROJECT#~/conda-bld/coverage/htmlcov/index.html```

To build the project inside a Docker container (requires Docker):
```
make dbuild
```

An arbitrary make target can be executed inside a Docker container by specifying the "MAKETARGET" parameter:
```
MAKETARGET='build' make dbuild
```
The list of make targets can be obtained by typing ```make```


The base Docker building environment is defined in the following Dockerfile:
```
resources/Docker/Dockerfile.dev
```

To format the code (please use this command before submitting any pull request):
```
make format
```

## Useful Docker commands

To manually create the container you can execute:
```
docker build --tag="~#VENDOR#~/~#PROJECT#~dev" .
```

To log into the newly created container:
```
docker run -t -i ~#VENDOR#~/~#PROJECT#~dev /bin/bash
```

To get the container ID:
```
CONTAINER_ID=`docker ps -a | grep ~#VENDOR#~/~#PROJECT#~dev | cut -c1-12`
```

To delete the newly created docker container:
```
docker rm -f $CONTAINER_ID
```

To delete the docker image:
```
docker rmi -f ~#VENDOR#~/~#PROJECT#~dev
```

To delete all containers
```
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```

To delete all images
```
docker rmi $(docker images -q)
```
